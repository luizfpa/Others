# 🗂️ Others (Utilities, Experiments & Proof of Concepts)

This repository contains miscellaneous scripts, experiments, and proof-of-concept projects related to data engineering and data science. It serves as a personal sandbox for learning, testing libraries, reusable code snippets, and experimenting with data processing techniques.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository includes:
- Python and SQL snippets for data manipulation.
- Small tests with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and PySpark.
- Exploratory notebooks.
- API or automation experiments.
- Utility functions for common data engineering tasks.

⚠️ **Note**: This repository is not intended for production-ready pipelines — its main purpose is educational, exploratory, and for future reference in real-world data engineering projects.
